Welcome to my data visualization blog! Each post contains a random project where I practice my coding and data science skills. I'll be covering all sorts of topics, from sports to biodiversity to climate science.

My posts will primarily utilize Python and R. I'll do my best to make every post fully reproducible. The blog is built and published using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
