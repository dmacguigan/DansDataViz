Today we're going to explore some sports data.
While watching my favorite hockey team this year (the Philadeplphia Flyers), I've felt like I barely know the players. There was a lot of turnover in the roster in the past couple of years. 

This got me thinking. Which year did the Flyers roster experience the most turnover?

To answer this question, we will turn to [hockey-reference.com/](https://www.hockey-reference.com/).

First, let's download a table of all Flyers players across the team's history. Rather than scraping the website, I manually accessed the data [here](https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/PHI/skaters.html#stats)

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 5 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
